In recent years, with advancements in technology, robotic process automation (RPA) has played a key role in enhancing the productivity of individual employees and businesses across diverse sectors like banking, healthcare, logistics,etc. Automation is applied to processes governed by specific rules and patterns, primarily those of a repetitive nature. This approach saves considerable time, money, and human effort, allowing resources to be redirected towards more creative tasks. In our research, we have considered the banking sector.

In the banking sector, where information flow can be disorganised and involve multiple stages, RPA proves highly beneficial. In this research paper, we have automated the loan approval process, in which a soft copy of the loan application and relevant documents of the proposed loan borrower from the bank are taken, and based upon bank policies for loan approval,applications can be filtered out. Using UI Path, the entire journey can be automated. We have facilitated document extraction, applied predefined conditions and regulations to filter loan applications, and then channelled the data in formats like JSON, XML, or API to the relevant authority for loan approval and integrated it with the bank portal. Moreover, we have extended our research to other aspects of the banking sector, like credit and debit card applications, account openings, fraud detection, and customer care services, offering a holistic automation solution at a broad level in the banking sector.
